        <h1>My Honeymoon in Costa Rica!</h1>
        <p class=heading>Here are a few highlights of my favorite trip!</p>
        <h2>Arenal</h2>

        <p>My husband and I spent five days in Costa Rica, staying at two different resorts in the area of the Arenal Volcano. Arenal is a long inactive volcano, but a breathtaking sight to see! </p>
        <h2>The Peace Lodge</h2>

        <p>The Peace Lodge was the first resort where we stayed. This resort is attached to La Paz Waterfall gardens. You can talk a walk on trails cutting through the rainforest and look at the amazing waterfalls. The resort also had a small zoo area. I enjoyed seeing all the animals. While we were staying here, we got to do a few fun activities:
        <ul>
        <li>Visited Poas Volcano (another great volcano that is actually mostly underground)</li>
        <li>Visited a coffee plantation </li>
        <li>Took a nightime tour of an animal preserve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Lost Iguana Resort</h2>

        <p>Our second resort was The Lost Iguana. With a view of the Arenal Volcano from our patio, this was certainly another memorable stay. The resort was fantastic and we were able to do some more exciting things like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Zip-lining through the canopy</li>
        <li>Conopy hiking tour</li>
        <li>Touring the Arenal Volcano</li>
        <li>Swimming in natural hot springs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overall Experience</h2>
        <p>Costa Rica was my favorite trip for a few reasons. One is the spectacular views. Being in rain forest, you are surrounded by nature. Also, being an animal person, I was ecstatic about getting to see and touch may different animals I wouldn't have been able to here.
            The food was amazing. We definitely did not go hungry. Lastly, the people are so warm and inviting. I can't wait until I can go again!
